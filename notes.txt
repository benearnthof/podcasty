# total cost of summarizing all Joe Rogan Episodes with ChatGPT:
~ 12500 words per hour
750 words = 1000 tokens
~ 17000 tokens per hour
6 cents per 1k tokens 
6*17 = 102 cents
conservative estimate: 1.05 dollars per hour of podcast
5811 hours of joe rogan so far
$6101.55 to summarize all joe rogan transcripts with the largest openai model
$3050 to summarize with 8k context window, would need to reprocess summary parts 

chatgpt 16k context: 
$0.003 per 1k tokens
$0.051 per hour of podcast
$300 to summarize all of JRE with chatgpt (gpt3.5 turbo)
probably a little more since most episodes would have to be processed in parts

need to test prompting to figure out the best quality
prompts also take up a small amount of tokens
